# ðŸŽ‡ EOD2

An automated Python script to download and update NSE stocks, indices, and delivery data.

Stock Data is stored as CSV files and adjusted for splits and bonuses. Ideal for use in backtesting.

If you :heart: my work so far, please :star2: this repo.

## IMPORTANT

Starting 8th July 2024, NSE will discontinue current equity bhavcopy in favor of new UDiFF format.

EOD2 v6.0.0 has been updated with new changes. [Follow the update instructions](https://github.com/BennyThadikaran/eod2/wiki/Installation#updating-the-git-repo)

## Notes

- `src/eod2_data/daily` contain OHLC and delivery data for individual stocks.
- A list of available indices can be found in `src/eod2_data/sector_watchlist.csv`.
- **Stock data before 2005 may not be fully adjusted** as NSE does not provide adjustment data before this year.
